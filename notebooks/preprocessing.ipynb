namco museum series lasted five games on the playstation , collecting old namco arcade titles ranging from the important ( such as pac - man , dig - dug , and galaxian ) to the obscure ( do toy pop , grobda , the tower of druaga , and phozon ring a bell ? ) . the nintendo 64 edition of the line acts as a \" best of \" the museum tour , gathering together the premium classic games from the company 's past : pac - man , ms. pac - man , pole position , galaga , galaxian , and dig dug . every gamer older than ten should be well familiar with the pellet - chomping , maze - running pac - man games , though some might not recall the other titles as clearly . pole position was the perennial racing game of its time , offering much - improved graphics to a genre that had seen the rudimentary - looking night driver not too much earlier . meanwhile , galaxian and galaga were more stylish takes on taito 's space invaders , each having its own distinct variation on the theme ( the first offered diving ships , while the second had enemies that could capture your craft in a tractor beam , for example ) . and dig dug ? this little game remains hard to explain even today . playing as what must be a gardener wearing a space suit , you dug into the ground to root out monsters ( the goggle - wearing balloon pooka and the fire - breathing dragon fygar ) either by blowing them up using an air pump or causing rocks to drop down on top of them . the graphics and sound in the games are , of course , incredibly dated by today 's standards , but , nonetheless , all remain almost as addictive today as when they first came out . few classic - game collections come close to providing such a strong lineup . while many of midway 's compilations had a few standout titles , most that appeared were second - tier games or ones that did n't hold up to the test of time very well . the namco museum line for the playstation saw this even more than the midway collections . and while some comps suffered from imperfect translations , the games on this one feel arcade perfect , save for some occasional trouble catching corners in pac - man and ms. pac - man using the n64 controller . it 's likely that you 'll find at least one game among the six that will make the collection worth picking up for you , but it could certainly be all of them , making this the surest classic compilation to ever recommend.--joe fielder -- copyright 1998 gamespot inc. all rights reserved . reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of gamespot is prohibited . -- gamespot review do n't be thrown off by the title of this game -- the artwork in this museum is n't the stuff that field trips are made of . instead , it 's a course in ancient video gaming that focuses on six of the format 's most important historical figures . start with the arcade version of the first family : pac - man and ms. pac - man . sadly , namco did n't include \" pac - man fever \" on the soundtrack . the next exhibit showcases variations from the top - down shooter period : galaga and galaxian . drive by pole position , an early milestone in gaming realism , and finally to dig dug , an early milestone in gaming surrealism , where the object is to dig underground and pump enough air into subterranean monsters to make them burst . remember : those who do n't know history are doomed to repeat it . namco museum 64    5\n","lee 's ghost house , 2 - 1/2 x 12 inches . lee 's ghost house - 2 - 1/2 x 12 - inches
